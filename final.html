    <h2> Credits Through Dynamic Map </h2>
    <p>
    As students, we have far too many times felt the fear of potentially having to retake a class again. When you retake a class again, not only do you have to redo all of the work, assignments, and exams, you also have to worry about whether redoing a class puts you behind in graduating, financial costs, and societal judgment. So it is salient to have credit recovery programs for students to make up these courses. Having a few close calls in the past made us curious about on average how many students take credit recovery per school, corresponding to their state. Thus, our visualization works to answer the question of: In the United States, on average, how many students in schools per state have completed credit recovery, and how has this changed from 2015 to 2017?
    </p>
    <p>
    When creating our visualization we opted to create a map where when you click on the state a barplot will show up displaying the average number of students participating in credit recovery programs at each school in each state between 2015 and 2017. Along the bar chart, there will also be a pop up clarifying the specific number of students on average between the two years. First, we had decided on creating a map because we felt like this would provide more context to the audience if we put it in a geographic perspective. For instance, it might be helpful to see that if the average of students is relatively higher in certain areas of the country like, the West Coast or East Coast, then it can help the audience make inferences about why that is or notice underlying trends. Additionally, we felt like utilizing a map would help our visualization with its clarity. We have 50 states, which would mean that if we had created a bar chart or a line plot we would have 50 components going on in our visualization that will make the visualization hard to interpret. Thus, we opted to utilize a map to help display geographical trends and help with the clarity and delivery of the data. Next, we had decided to include a bar chart when you click on the desired state because we wanted to display the difference in the average amount of students between 2015 and 2017. A bar chart allows for the audience to compare the difference between averages proportionally from each other. For instance, Nevada's average from 2017 tripled in size from 2015, and the bar chart easily conveys this proportion. Finally, we added the pop up with the values to enhance the clarity of the bar plots. The pop ups provide the audience with the exact averages which have been difficult to see exactly in the bar chart.
    </p>
    <p>
    Keeping in mind color-encoding and modeling color perception, we decided to choose dark green as the color of the bars in our bar chart since this color matches the green-blue color scheme of the map.
    Both of the bars are the same color to signal to the users that both bars reflect the same type of data (the average number of students engaged with credit recovery per school in the state clicked on in the map). The colors in our map reflect the colors and style often associated with online, interactive maps, which furthers the utility of this visualization for users due to their previous encounters with such interfaces. On the map, the United States (inland + Alaska and Hawaii) is in a contrasting darker color to the rest of the areas on the map to bring attention to locations our main question aims to analyze. The bar chart only appears directly below the map immediately after the state is clicked on so that the users will be able to understand that the bar chart reflects the area on the map selected, as highlighted by the title of the bar chart and the pop up information that floats above the selected state in the bright color of white shining in contrast to the dim background to focus attention on the data values themselves (the average credits per year in the schools in that state).
    </p>
    <p>
    Knowing that we wanted to focus on data regarding each of the schools across all U.S. states over multiple years, the first step of our groupsâ€™ development process involves choosing an appropriate dataset. An ideal dataset is one that includes data over a range of years, has no or very limited (less than 2%) missing values, and includes data on all 50 states. An early issue involved encountering datasets that only included data regarding a subset of the 50 states or data that contained many missing values in the desired column. To tackle this problem and our limited resources on jupyter notebooks in conjunction with APIs, we had to download the csv file of the data rather than requesting it via an API, though many csv files were too large for our computers to open so we had to find one of minimal size. After, we had to clean the data, filtering for specific years and dropping irrelevant columns, and finally grouping by year (2015, 2017) and state to find the average values (the average number of students participating in credit recovery programs at each school in each state). These values were then transferred over manually to the geojson file. These steps took a lengthy amount of time (7 hours) and were done via a collaboration of Deepika and Andrea.

    Simultaneously, Hillary mainly worked on coding the map first which took the most time out of the whole process. At first we had decided to do something similar to lab 6 where we would follow the steps on how to make a map, however instead of just looking at one small area in a state we wanted to look at all the states in America. Additionally, we wanted to add different features like having a specific state highlighted whenever the user hovered over it. However, this is when we came to our first road block where we could not get the states to be highlighted regardless of what we had done. We then scrapped the idea of using parts of what we had learned in lab 6, at this point this was around 3 hours of work. Afterwards, we decided then to look up documentation on mapboxgl and watch a few tutorials on how to create a map using svelte to highlight the states as the user hovers over it. However, again we struggled with getting the states highlighted, but this time we had a suspicion it was the csv. Despite our suspicion, we scrapped the code again to try using html instead of svelte (this trial took about 5 hours). After attending office hours, we realized that at the time we were importing our csv with the averages separately from the geojson file that contained the longitude and latitude of the states. So as we mentioned before, we then realized we had to include the data we got from the csv file to be included into the geojson file so we can bring in both simultaneously. This is when we were finally able to get to interact with each individual state. Finally, we utilized d3 to help make the bar plots that come up with clicking on a state (this took about 4 hours). Thus the aspect of trying to utilize and understand a framework like Svelte library with the d3 framework took the most amount of time and caused us the most struggle. Particularly, Hillary took a while to realize the geojson file had to be publicly hosted to work with the visualization. Researching how to make the geojson work with the visualization took a lot of time. Overall, the process took about 12 hours and was done by Hillary.
